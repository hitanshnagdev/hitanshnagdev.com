      cloud-based business communications solutions
      that include message, video, phone, and contact center services.
      <br><br>

      <u class="bigger">My role: </u><br>I was a product management intern mainly focusing on the user
      deployment process for enterprises. Some of my key tasks were to collaborate
      cross-functionally with multiple stakeholders like professional
      services, customer support/training, and the sales team on a
      weekly basis to identify and prioritize consumer pain points. While
      I worked closely with the design and software team to come up
      with a functional prototype I was mainly responsible for creating
      wireframes, epics, user stories, success metrics, A/B
      tests, and monthly presentations.
      <br><br>

      <u class="bigger">Result: </u><br>Created an onboarding tool to automate and accelerate
      the data migration process that
      significantly decreased the onboarding time for enterprises
      (100+ users).

        Venmo is a PayPal service that allows you to easily purchase
        items and split checks without using a credit card. It is a
        peer to peer payment app where users can send money to friends
        and family without needing cash or checks.
        <br><br>

        <u class="venmo-bigger">My role: </u><br>
        I started off by pitching my idea to a class of 80 students
        of introducing a feature within
        Venmo that allows users to create and conduct payments in groups.
        After recruiting a team of 6 students (designers and engineers)
        some of my key leadership tasks were to implement a
        scrum agile methodology, conduct bi-weekly sprints, maintain
        product backlogs, and define product scope. Based on customer
        feedback we shifted our focus to implementing a recurring payments
        feature as shown in the demo on the right.
        <br><br>

        <u class="venmo-bigger">Result: </u><br>
        Developed a feature add
        on in Venmo that can split equal and unequal bills on a
      recurring basis in a group setting. Decreased avg no. of clicks
    to conduct payments in bulk by 90%.

    Predicted the no. of acres burned and days

    Some of the machine learning models used were K-means clustering
    (elbow method), logistic regression, neural network, and decision trees.
    Ensembled all prediction models with a testing accuracy of 71.96% and
    predicted (1) whether a fire is a major incident or not based on
    the number of acres burned and (2)
    how many days will the fire burn for.
